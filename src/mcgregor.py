def mcs_mcgregor(G, H, anchor_point={}):
    '''
    Computes the Maximum Common Subgraph using the Algorithm suggested by
    James J. McGregor in 1982.

    `Precondition`: |V_G| <= |V_H|

        `Paramters`:
            G (Graph): A NetworkX graph
            H (Graph): A NetworkX graph

        `Optional`:
            anchor_point (dict: int -> int): A valid mapping from nodes in G to nodes in H
        
        `Returns`:
            mapping (dict: int -> int): The node correspondence for the MCS
            marcs (np.array): The MARCS array for the MCS
            arcsleft (int): The number of arcs in G that can be mapped to arcs in H

    If an anchor point is given (i.e. a subgraph isomorphism between G and H),
    the algorithm produces a common subgraph branching out from this anchor point.
